  title =        { Semantics Of Non-Terminating Systems Through Term
                  Rewriting },
  school =       { Oxford University },

  month =        aug,
  abstract =     { This thesis is primarily concerned with the
                  algebraic semantics of non-terminating term
                  rewriting systems. The usual semantics for rewrite
                  system is based in interpreting rewrite rules as
                  equations and rewriting as a particular case of
                  equational reasoning. The termination of a rewrite
                  system ensures that every term has a value (normal
                  form). But, in general we cannot guarantee this. The
                  research that has been done on non-terminating
                  rewrite systems is centered on seeking semantics for
                  these systems where the usual properties of
                  confluent systems (like uniqueness of normal forms)
                  still hold. These approaches extend the original set
                  of terms (with infinite terms) in such a way that
                  every term has a value. We propose a new semantics
                  for rewrite systems based on interpreting rewrite
                  rules as in-equations between terms in an ordered
                  algebra. We show that a variant of equational logic
                  --- inequational logic --- is an institution and we
                  further prove that rewriting is a sound and complete
                  proof system for this logic. For the case of
                  confluent systems, we show that the algebra of
                  normal forms in a terminating system is a uniquely
                  minimal covering of the term algebra. In the
                  non-terminating case, the existence of this minimal
                  covering is established in the completion of an
                  ordered algebra formed by rewriting sequences. We
                  thus generalize the properties of normal forms for
                  non-terminating systems to this minimal
                  covering. These include the existence of normal
                  forms for arbitrary rewrite systems, and their
                  uniqueness for confluent systems, in which case the
                  algebra of normal forms is isomorphic to the
                  canonical quotient algebra associated with the rules
                  when seen as equations. This extends the benefits of
                  algebraic semantics to systems with
                  non-deterministic and non-terminating
                  computations. We first study properties of abstract
                  orders, and then instantiate these to term rewriting
                  systems. Furthermore, we review the theory of
                  rewriting systems without any restriction on the
                  form of the rules. In this review we include a
                  comparison between several definitions of concurrent
                  rewriting. }

                  evaluation of our approach and comment on
                  alternative approaches for the refinement of
                  concurrent object oriented programs, concluding that
                  none of them provide both a general definition of
                  refinement and an effective proof technique such as
                  the one presented here. },

                  language for which an operational semantics has been
                  provided. This paper gives an equivalent distributed
                  semantics which describes how FOOPS objects
                  co-operate in evaluating a program. The distributed
                  semantics is presented using transition systems. We
                  relate transition systems and sheaves to also give a
                  sheaf-theoretic semantics. By implementing the
                  distributed semantics in Eqlog, we obtain a FOOPS
                  simulator. Thus, our distributed semantics is both
                  axiomatic and executable. }

  abstract =     { This monograph consists of four papers on social
                  and philosophical aspects of computing. The first,
                  third and fourth were written for the book Software
                  Development and Reality Construction, which grew out
                  of an interdisciplinary conference held in Schloss
                  Eringerfeld, Germany, in September of 1988. The
                  second was written as a position paper for the
                  conference Formal Methods 89 which was held in
                  Halifax, Nova Scotia in July of 1989. The first
                  paper is concerned with the role of errors in
                  computing, and in particular, with the regrettable
                  tendency within some schools of Formal Methods to
                  claim that errors can and should play no role at
                  all. The second paper is largely concerned with
                  philosophical aspects of Formal Methods, and in
                  particular with the recent controversies about
                  whether computing systems can be "proved correct,"
                  and indeed, with what we mean by "proved" and by
                  "correct," and how such mathematical concepts
                  connect with the real world. The third paper goes
                  somewhat deeper into certain philosophical problems
                  about meaning and truth. It contrasts the "modern"
                  formalist position of the logical positivists like
                  Carnap with the views of Heidegger and
                  Wittgenstein. This has serious consequences for our
                  understanding of correctness problems in
                  computing. The fourth paper takes us somewhat
                  further afield. It is an attempt to connect the
                  process of interpretation with the philosophy of
                  Buddhist meditation. }

                  Requirements Engineering; these opposite but
                  complementary aspects of information are called "the
                  dry" and "the wet". Requirements Engineering has a
                  strong need to reconcile the dry and the
                  wet. Following some background on the culture of
                  Computing Science, the paper describes some projects
                  in the Centre for Requirements and Foundations at
                  Oxford. These are: a taxonomy for Requirements
                  Engineering methods; applying techniques from
                  sociology and sociolinguistics to requirements
                  elicitation, and in particular, to determining the
                  values of an organisation. These projects draw on
                  ideas from ethnomethodology and Conversation
                  Analysis. The paper also demonstrates that
                  structures as dry as abstract data types occur in
                  the ordinary discourse of social groups. }

  abstract =     { This monograph consists of two papers which jointly
                  summarize research in the Rewrite Rule Machine (RRM)
                  Project as of about the end of 1988. Research in
                  this period focussed on two topics: the design of
                  very high level multi-paradigm programming
                  languages; and an architecture for executing such
                  languages using graph rewriting. The first paper,
                  "Software for the Rewrite Rule Machine," gives an
                  overview of RRM implementation techniques for
                  functional, relational ("logic"), and object
                  oriented languages, as well as for their
                  combinations. This paper is nearly the same as one
                  that appeared on pages 628-637 of the Proceedings of
                  the International Conference on Fifth Generation
                  Computer Systems, held in Toyko in November
                  1988. The languages are unusual because their
                  designs are based directly on logic, and nothing has
                  been allowed to compromise their basis in logic. The
                  second paper, "Cell, Tile and Ensemble Architecture
                  of the Rewrite Rule Machine," describes the quite
                  unconventional hierarchical architecture of a custom
                  VLSI chip, called a rewrite ensemble, which
                  processes data directly in memory, in SIMD mode. A
                  complete RRM consists of many independent rewrite
                  ensembles connected over a network. This paper is a
                  very substantial modification of one appearing on
                  pages 869-878 of the same Proceedings. }

  abstract =     { This paper generalizes many-sorted algebra
                  (hereafter, MSA) to order-sorted algebra (hereafter,
                  OSA) by alowing a partial ordering relation on the
                  set of sorts. This supports abstract data types with
                  multiple inheritance (in roughly the sense of
                  object-oriented programming), several forms of
                  polymorphism and overloading, partial operations (as
                  total on equationally defined subsorts), exception
                  handling, and an operational semantics based on term
                  rewriting. We give the basic algebraic constructions
                  for OSA, including Quotient, Homomorphism, and
                  Initiality Theorems. The paper's major mathematical
                  results include a notion of OSA deduction, a
                  Completeness Theorem for it, and an OSA Birkhoff
                  Variety Theorem. We also develop conditional OSA,
                  including Initiality, Completeness, and
                  McKinsey-Malcev Quasivariety Theorems, and we reduce
                  OSA to (conditional) MSA, which allows lifting many
                  known MSA results to OSA. Retracts, which
                  intuitively are left inverses to subsort inclusions,
                  provide relatively inexpensive run-time error
                  handling. We show that it is safe to add retracts to
                  any OSA signature, in the sense that it gives rise
                  to a conservative extension. A final section
                  compares and contrasts many different approaches to
                  OSA. This paper also includes several examples
                  demonstrating the flexibility and applicability of
                  OSA, including some standard benchmarks like STACK
                  and LIST, as well as a much more substantial
                  example, the number hierarchy from the naturals up
                  to the quaternions. }

  abstract =     { This paper argues that a powerful module
                  composition facility can enhance the ability of
                  object oriented languages to reuse and compose
                  designs, specifications and code. In addition,
                  several flexible ways to produce prototypes can be
                  supported, including symbolic execution of designs,
                  composing prototype versions of components, and
                  using "built-in" modules. Much of this power comes
                  from having module expressions, theories and views
                  as first class citizens; some comes from providing
                  both vertical and horizontal composition, and from
                  distinguishing between sorts for values, classes for
                  objects, modules for code, and theories as types for
                  modules. New features introduced in this paper
                  include dynamic binding with views, vertical
                  wrappers, support for abstract classes and private
                  class inheritance, and the dynamic integration of
                  components from different libraries. Although we
                  illustrate these features using the FOOPS language,
                  they could be added to many other languages, and
                  some comparison with other languages is given. }

  abstract =     { The notions of state and observable behaviour are
                  fundamental to many areas of computer
                  science. Hidden sorted algebra, an extension of many
                  sorted algebra, captures these notions through
                  hidden sorts and the behavioural satisfaction of
                  equations. This makes it a powerful formalisation of
                  abstract machines, and many results suggest that it
                  is also suitable for the semantics of the object
                  paradigm. Another extension of many sorted algebra,
                  namely order sorted algebra, has proved useful in
                  system specification and prototyping because of the
                  way it handles subtypes and errors. The combination
                  of these two algebraic approaches, hidden order
                  sorted algebra, has also been proposed as a
                  foundation for object paradigm, and has much promise
                  as a foundation for Software Engineering. This paper
                  extends recent work on hidden order sorted algebra
                  by investigating the refinement and implementation
                  of hidden order sorted specifications. We present
                  definitions of refinement and implementation for
                  such specifications, and techniques for proving that
                  one specification refines or implements another. It
                  is important that the notions of refinement and
                  implementation be tractable, in the sense that there
                  are efficient techniques for proving their
                  correctness. The proof techniques given in this
                  paper lead, we believe, to correctness proofs that
                  are much simpler than others in the literature. We
                  found that proving refinement is an effective way to
                  prove implementation correctness. Some examples are
                  given. Any foundation for the semantics of
                  programming should also support modular
                  specifications. The "institutions" developed by
                  Goguen and Burstall are useful for this
                  purpose. Institutions formalise the notion of
                  logical system, and provide an encapsulation
                  property for specifications: when one specification
                  is imported into another, properties that hold of
                  that specification in isolation remain true in its
                  new context. An important technical result of this
                  paper is that hidden order sorted algebra forms an
                  institution, and therefore supports the modular
                  specification of systems of objects. The paper also
                  includes an exposition of hidden order sorted
                  algebra, and brief introductions to many sorted
                  algebra, order sorted algebra, and institutions. }

  review =       { Points of note:
                   0. Very strong reliance on OBJ3 semantics and
                      features.  FOOPS is just OBJ3++. :)
                   1. Semantics of class inheritance are fixed.
                      (method redefinition is only contravariant)
                      See Castago95 for more details.
                   2. Accessing original versions of methods (i.e.
                      "super" access) is defined (in a limited fashion
                       but not supported in the implementation.
                   3. The term "kind" is used as "sort or class".
                   4. Views can only be defined between modules and
                      theories at the same level in the language in
                      the present implementation.
                   5. View definitions can even be more terse than as
                      seen in OBJ3.  In particular, a class, sort,
                      operator, attribute, or method can be used as
                      the view to construct a default abbreviated view 
                      to the theory or module containing the construct.
                   Thoughts: 
                   0. Kind Theory is just FOOPS extended to the
                      meta-level. 
                   1. Use of diagrams was claimed to be essential in
                      GoguenTracz97.  Consider the use of UML and OPEN
                      as self-specification at the metalevel plus the
                      use of Category Theory. (!) }

  abstract =     {This paper presents indexed categories, which model
                  uniformly defined families of categories, and
                  suggests that they are a useful tool for the working
                  computer scientist. An indexed category gives rise
                  to a single flattened category as a disjoint union
                  of its component categories plus some additional
                  morphisms. Similarly, an indexed functor (which is a
                  uniform family of functors between the component
                  categories) induces a flattened functor between the
                  corresponding flattened categories. Under certain
                  assumptions, flattened categories are (co)complete
                  if all their components are, and flattened functors
                  have left adjoints if all their components
                  do. Several examples are given. Although this paper
                  is part 3 of the series "Some Fundamental Algebraic
                  Tools for the Semantics of Computation," it is
                  entirely independent of parts 1 and 2.}

                  play in algebraic approaches to specification of
                  Abstract Data Types (ADTs) and show how they
                  influence expressivity and mechanizability. In the
                  last two decades many different logic systems for
                  the algebraic specification of ADTs have been
                  developed, each one pursuing its own principles and
                  goals. Since a careful analysis of these logical
                  systems, taking into account not only their
                  expressivity, but also their mechanizability, is
                  important to clarify and organizse a rather rich and
                  controversial subject - for example overloading is a
                  topic that needs to be clarified - we believe our
                  contribution will be useful. Mechanizability of
                  logical systems is in fact as important as
                  expressivity, and becomes crucial for those logical
                  systems which are meant to define the semantics of
                  declarative and rapid prototyping languages. We have
                  taken great care to present all arguments in this
                  paper in as elementary a way as possible, in order
                  to make the paper accessible to non-expert readers,
                  even though a minimum knowledge of category theory
                  and institutions might be of help in few points. }

                  the functional form of the Bird-Meertens
                  Formalism. The implementation allows
                  "leftmost-outermost" and "rightmost-innermost"
                  rewriting orders to be selected, and conditional
                  higher-order rewrite rules to be used. The results
                  are encouraging and suggest that systems which use
                  rewrite rules can achieve greater conciseness,
                  applicability, and efficiency. }
