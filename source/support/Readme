obj-tex, examples.c, showpos.c, region.c

The script obj-tex may need to be modified, look for uses of the commands:
  examples obj
These uses could be changed to refer to specific paths.

The programs region.c and showpos.c are intended for people who want
to be able to interpret the OBJ3 error messages that refer to
character positions in input files, but don't use an editor that makes
it easy to do so (e.g., vi).  Both of these programs can be used to
examine pieces of a file specified by character positions.

You can build the program example simply by "make examples", and
likewise "region" and "showpos".
