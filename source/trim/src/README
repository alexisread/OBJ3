This directory contains the implementation of the three
components of TRIM: compiler, optimizer, assembler.
In addition it contains a driver (trimcc) which coordinates
the different components during a compilation.

To build these components:
* edit the 'BUILD_TARGET' macro in the Makefile to point to an 
  appropriate bin directory.
* edit 'BUILD_TARGET' macro in 'config.h' to point to the same 
  bin directory as above.
* make sure that the above bin directory is in your PATH.
* run make

These files contain utilities shared by all components:
basics.cxx
basics.hxx
config.hxx
const.hxx
fileio.c
fileio.h
util.hxx
mem.cxx

Assembler implementation:
asm.hxx
asmlists.cxx
asmlists.hxx
trimasm.cxx
trimgram.y
trimscan.l

The equation compiler:
eqcomp.cxx
eqcomp.hxx
eqgram.y
eqscan.l

The optimizer:
opt.cxx
opt.hxx
trimopt.cxx
(this component also uses files from the assembler)

The trim abstract machine implementation:
trim.cxx
trim.hxx
trim_instr.imp
trimmain.cxx

The driver:
config.h
obstack.c
obstack.h
trimcc.c
trimcc.h
